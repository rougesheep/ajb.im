    <div class="container">
      <p class="lead">Set up a Raspberry Pi as torrent downloader and media server.</p>
      <h2>Initial Setup</h2>
      <p>I did this using a Raspberry Pi 2 model B but could be done with any Linux box, I don't think any of these steps are Debian specific. These steps will also work on the original Raspberry Pi's but performance might be an issue.</p>
      <p>Get your Raspberry Pi set up with Rasbian and update it. You'll also want to get a static IP set up, either on the Raspberry Pi or a lot of routers let you set a device to keep its IP.</p>
      <h2>Transmission</h2>
      <p>The torrent server we'll be running is called <a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a>. As well as a graphical interface there is a version which runs as a service and can be controlled via command line or a web interface. We'll be using the later. Install it by running:</p>
      <ul class="code">
        <li>sudo apt-get install transmission-daemon</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We'll need to make some changes to its config file, but transmission is a bit strange. It writes its config file on exiting so any edits made it is running will be lost. First, stop the daemon if it started on install then edit the config file:</p>
      <ul class="code">
        <li>sudo service transmission-daemon stop</li>
        <li>sudo mkdir /usr/lib/transmission-daemon/incomplete</li>
        <li>sudo vim /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You'll want to edit a few lines to enable the incomplete directory and allow connection to the web interface:</p>
      <ul class="code">
        <li>incomplete-dir: /var/lib/transmission-daemon/incomplete;</li>
        <li>incomplete-dir-enabled: true;</li>
        <li>rpc-whitelist-enabled: false;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I also like to disable password authentication on the web interface:</p>
      <ul class="code">
        <li>rpc-authentication-required: false;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then start the daemon again:</p>
      <ul class="code">
        <li>sudo service transmission-daemon start</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This isn't exactly the most secure set up. You can see the full list of options on the <a href="https://trac.transmissionbt.com/wiki/EditConfigFiles">Transmission Wiki</a>. Just remember, transmission must be stopped while you're editing the file.</p>
      <p>Right, that should be transmission up and running. You should be able to access the web interface by pointing your web browser at http://&lt; ip address &gt;:9091. Add a few torrents and they should download to the incomplete folder then move to the download folder once they're finished. This is important for the DLNA server. Feel free to change these paths if you want it to download to external storage.</p>
      <h2>MiniDLNA</h2>
      <p>Actually called ReadyMedia but the package is still called minidlna. We'll also need inotify for automatically detecting new files. Install them:</p>
      <ul class="code">
        <li>sudo apt-get install minidlna inotify-tools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Next edit a few lines in its config file (/etc/minidlna.conf):</p>
      <ul class="code">
        <li>media_dir=V,/var/lib/transmission-daemon/downloads</li>
        <li>inotify=yes</li>
        <li>friendly_name=&lt; some name &gt;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The friendly name shows up when you're browing for media servers. To restart the servive and rebuild the media database (you'll need to do this if you add or change media locations) run:</p>
      <ul class="code">
        <li>sudo service minidlna force-reload</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That should be you all done. Go and enjoy your totally legitimately obtained videos on whatever DLNA supporting device you want!</p>
      <h2>Bonus Points</h2>
      <p>It's true that you can torrent more than just videos and minidlna supports audio and image folders too. The only issue being each folder should have one type of media in it. Transmission supports running scripts on finishing a download so you could write a simple script to check the file type downloaded and move it to the matching folder, say /opt/media/video, /opt/media/music. Then have those folders set up in minidlna.conf. You wouldn't need the incomplete folder this way either.</p>
