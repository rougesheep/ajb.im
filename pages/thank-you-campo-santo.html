      <p class="lead">I've just finished up playing <a href="http://www.firewatchgame.com">Firewatch</a> and I loved it. I just wanted to thank Campo Santo for the game and for including dementia in it. I thought it gave an interesting edge to the story. I thought I'd share it here too:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>This isn't a support request, I just wanted to reach out to you guys and this is the only email I could find. Thank you for making this game. I first found out about it maybe a year ago when someone posted up an Android homescreen using artwork from the game and it's been my background on my desktop, at work and on my phone. It's just so beautiful!</p>
        <p>Then the game came out and the intro really hit me. My Grandad had dementia and before he went into a home I remember going round to visit. He greeted us at the door, my mum, my dad and as I stepped up to the door he turned and ask kindly "and who are you?". You should never have to introduce yourself as "Your grandson." It was so weird. I have no idea how it made him feel but I never saw him again after that. I couldn't deal with it and I didn't want to put him through the same thing again. The intro just brought all that back to me and I just wasn't expecting that kind of story in this game.</p>
        <p>I just want to say thank you for including dementia in this game and getting it so spot on.</p>
        <p>Thanks for the awesome game and I look forward to the next (and my photos)!</p>
        <p>Regards,<br/>Andy Burne</p>
